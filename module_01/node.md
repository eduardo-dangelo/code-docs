# Node - Basics

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to build server-side applications with JavaScript, and is commonly used for building web servers, APIs, and other networked applications.

## Installing Node.js

To install Node.js, go to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system. Once the download is complete, run the installer to begin the installation process.

## Running Node.js

To run Node.js, open a terminal window and type `node`, followed by the name of the JavaScript file you want to execute. For example, to run a file called "app.js," you would type:

```shell
node app.js
```

and press Enter.

## Creating a Node.js Project

To create a new Node.js project, create a new directory and navigate to it using the terminal. Then, run the `npm init` command to initialize the project. This will create a `package.json` file, which is used to manage the dependencies and scripts for your project.

## Installing Packages with npm

Node.js uses the npm (Node Package Manager) to manage packages and dependencies. To install a package, run the `npm install` command followed by the name of the package you want to install. For example, to install the "express" package, you would type:

```shell
npm install express
```

and press Enter.
