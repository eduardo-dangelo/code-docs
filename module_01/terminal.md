> A terminal shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with their computer's operating system using text-based commands. It can be used for a variety of tasks and is often used by advanced users and developers.

## Creating a New Folder

To create a new folder, use the `mkdir` command followed by the name of the folder you want to create. For example, to create a folder called "newfolder," you would type:
```shell
mkdir newfolder
```
and press Enter.

## Navigating to a Different Folder

To navigate to a different folder, use the `cd` command followed by the path to the folder you want to go to. For example, to navigate to the "Documents" folder in your home directory, you would type:
```shell
cd Documents
```

and press Enter.

## Seeing a List of the Files and Folders in a Directory

To see a list of the files and folders in your current directory, use the `ls` command. You can also use the `ls` command with a specific directory path to see the contents of that directory. For example, to see the contents of the "Documents" folder in your home directory, you would type:
```shell
ls Documents
```

and press Enter.

## Copying a File or Folder

To copy a file or folder, use the `cp` command followed by the source file or folder and the destination. For example, to copy a file called "file.txt" from the current directory to the "Documents" folder, you would type:
```shell
cp file.txt Documents
```

and press Enter.

To move a file or folder, use the `mv` command followed by the source file or folder and the destination. For example, to move a file called "file.txt" from the current directory to the "Documents" folder, you would type:
```shell
mv file.txt Documents
```

and press Enter.

## Deleting a File

To delete a file, use the `rm` command followed by the name of the file you want to delete. For example, to delete a file called "file.txt," you would type:
```shell
rm file.txt
```
and press Enter.

## Deleting a Folder and All Its Contents

To delete a folder and all its contents, use the `rm -r` command followed by the name of the folder you want to delete. For example, to delete a folder called "folder" and all its contents, you would type:
