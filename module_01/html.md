## HTML

HTML **Hyper Text Markup Language** was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 and published in 1995 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers.


HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
It consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content.

#### Example of html file: `file_name.html`

<!DOCTYPE html>
