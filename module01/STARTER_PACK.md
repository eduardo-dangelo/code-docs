# ðŸŽ’ STARTER PACK

> Welcome to the starter Pack.
> The guide for configuring your machine to be fully functional for professional coding.
> After this you should be ready to crack some code.
> Just make sure you follow the process until the end. 


## Choose your IDE
>IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the software that will help you code efficiently.
These are the best IDEs (in my opinion).
Choose your IDE from list below.
- [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Download Web Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)


## Install Node.js
>An open source platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.
Find more about what is node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).
- [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). 


## Install GIT
>Git is a free and open-source version control system that enables multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.
We will be installing git via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
Find out other forms you can install git [here](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).
1. [Install homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. Open a terminal and run:
    ```
    brew install git
    ```


## Install Oh my zsh
>Oh My Zsh is an open source framework for managing your zsh configuration.
It comes packed with functions, themes, and plugins to improve the default ZSH shell.
It will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one!
Check full documentation [here](https://ohmyz.sh/)

- Open a terminal and run:
    ``` 
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    ```
