# ðŸ›  Code Format (ESLint & Prettier)
> In this section we will be configuring `ESLint` and `Prettier` to format our code.
> This will help us to keep our code consistent across all files and avoid bugs.
>> Configuration guides are easy to forget since we don't use them often. Keep this module as a reference when configuring your environment.
