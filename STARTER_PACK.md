### â‘  Choose your IDE
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the software that will help you code efficiently.
These are the best IDEs (in my opinion).
Choose your IDE from list below.
- [download Web Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
- [download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### â‘¡ Customise your IDE
Make sure you get the most of your IDE.

### â‘£ Install GIT
Git is a free and open-source version control system that enables multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.
1. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then open a terminal and run:
    ```
    brew install git
    ```

### â‘¤ Install Oh my zsh
The MacOS terminal uses z shell (zsh) as the default shell. Oh My Zsh is an open source framework for managing your zsh configuration.
It comes packed with functions, themes, and plugins to improve the default ZSH shell.
It will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one!
Check full documentation [here](https://ohmyz.sh/)
1. Open a terminal and run
      ```
      sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
      ```

### â‘¥ Configure a SSH key
SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used for connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit.
Check how can you generate a new ssh key [here](./SSH.md).
