# MODULE 2 - GETTING STARTED

> Welcome to module 2 of The Complete Front-End Web Development Crash Course! In this module,
> we'll be covering the tools and concepts you'll need to get started with web development.
> It may seem overwhelming at first, but with repetition and practice, it will become clear as water.
> By the end of this module, you'll have a good understanding of:
> - How to set up your development environment.
> - How to use Git and GitHub.
> - How to use VS-Code or Web Storm.
> - How to format code using Eslint and Prettier.
> - Basic concepts of React.
>
>> Configuration guides are easy to forget since we don't use them often. Keep this module as a reference when configuring your environment.
