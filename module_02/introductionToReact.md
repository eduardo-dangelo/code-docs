> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
> It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
> React can be used to create single-page or mobile applications.


### Example of React: `App.jsx`
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
    
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#root'));
```
> The above code is a React component. It is a function that returns JSX. JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. JSX gets compiled to React.createElement() calls which return plain JavaScript objects called ‚ÄúReact elements‚Äù. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM. You can learn more about JSX in the next lesson.
> 
> Notice how add the html elements inside javascript code. This is the power of JSX. You can write HTML directly within JavaScript. This is the reason why React is called a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
> 
> Notice ReactDOM.render() method. This method is used to render the React component to the DOM. The first argument is the React component and the second argument is the DOM element where you want to render the React component. In the above example, we are rendering the App component to the DOM element with id root. You can find the index.html file in the public folder. The index.html file is the entry point of the React application. The index.html file is the only HTML file in the React application. All the other HTML files are generated by React. You can learn more about the index.html file in the next lesson.

## React Components
> React components are the building blocks of a React application's user interface. This means that everything in a React application, from buttons to forms, is a React component. React components are written using JSX, which allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. React components are typically written as functions or classes. This means that you can either define a component as a function or as a class. The main difference between the two approaches is that you use state in class components, but you do not use state in function components. You will learn more about state in the next lesson.

### Example of React Components:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const Greetings = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greetings name="John" />
      <Greetings name="Jane" />
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#root'));
```
> In the above example, we have two React components: Greetings and App. The Greetings component is a function component. The App component is a class component. The App component is a parent component of the Greetings component. The Greetings component is a child component of the App component. The App component is rendering the Greetings component twice. The App component is passing the name prop to the Greetings component. The Greetings component is receiving the name prop and displaying it in the h1 tag. You can learn more about props in the next lesson.

## Create React App
> Create React App is a tool built by developers at Facebook to help you build React applications. It saves you from time-consuming setup and configuration. You simply run one command and Create React App sets up the tools you need to start your React project.
>We will be using the `create-react-app` command to generate our first app.
> Check out the full documentation on how to create a react app [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
1. Open a terminal
2. Create a `projects` directory by running:
    ```
    mkdir projects
    ```
3. Navigate to `projects` directory:
    ```
    cd projects
    ```
4. Create a react app called `code-playground`:
    ```
    npx create-react-app code-playground
    ```
5. Navigate to `code-playground` and start the project:
    ```
    cd code-playground
    npm start
    ```
