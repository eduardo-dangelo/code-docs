## IDE
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the software where you write your code and run it.
It will also help you code efficiently.
It's important to choose a good IDE that will help you write code faster and with less errors.

> If you're just starting I recommend using VS-Code. It's easy to use and it's free.
> I recommend switching Web Storm when you get a bit more experience.
> It's a paid IDE but it's worth it.
- Choose your IDE:
