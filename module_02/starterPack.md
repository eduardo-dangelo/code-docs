# ðŸŽ’ STARTER PACK

> Before we start, we need to make sure we have all the tools we need to start coding.
> Please, make sure you follow the instructions carefully.
> You need to complete all the steps before moving on to the next module.

## IDE
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the software where you write your code and run it. It will also help you code efficiently. It's important to choose a good IDE that will help you write code faster and with less errors.
> If you're just starting I recommend using VS-Code. It's easy to use and it's free.
I recommend switching Web Storm when you get a bit more experience.
It's a paid IDE but it's worth it.
